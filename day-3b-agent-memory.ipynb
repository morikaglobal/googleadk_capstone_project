    "### 6.1 Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "ADK's callback system lets you hook into key execution moments. Callbacks are **Python functions** you define and attach to agents - ADK automatically calls them at specific stages, acting like checkpoints during the agent's execution flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of callbacks as event listeners in your agent's lifecycle.** When an agent processes a request, it goes through multiple stages: receiving the input, calling the LLM, invoking tools, and generating the response. Callbacks let you insert custom logic at each of these stages without modifying the core agent code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Available callback types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `before_agent_callback` → Runs before agent starts processing a request\n",
    "- `after_agent_callback` → Runs after agent completes its turn  \n",
    "- `before_tool_callback` / `after_tool_callback` → Around tool invocations\n",
    "- `before_model_callback` / `after_model_callback` → Around LLM calls\n",
    "- `on_model_error_callback` → When errors occur\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common use cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logging and observability (track what the agent does)\n",
    "- Automatic data persistence (like saving to memory)\n",
    "- Custom validation or filtering\n",
    "- Performance monitoring\n",

    "### 6.2 Automatic Memory Storage with Callbacks\n",

    "   - Initialize `MemoryService` alongside `SessionService`\n",
    "   - Both services are provided to the `Runner`\n",

    "2. **✅ Storing Information**\n",
    "   - `await memory_service.add_session_to_memory(session)`\n",
    "   - Transfers session data to long-term storage\n",

    "\n",

    "   - `await memory_service.search_memory(app_name, user_id, query)`\n",
    "   - Returns relevant memories from past conversations\n",

    "4. **✅ Retrieving in Agents**\n",

    "   - **Proactive:** `preload_memory` tool (always loads memory into LLM's system instructions)\n",
